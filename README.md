# pc-killers

Just a random collection of tiny scripts, that will make you computer lag.
Quick reminder that they are made for fun and only for fun. I just like finding simple ways to break stuff.
If you want these scripts to work "more efficiently", just replace `for` loop with `while True` one :)

## explorer-spammer.py

This script will open multiple instances of explorers, which will definitely cause lag

## file-spammer.py

This script will create a file of the selected size and duplicate it, so you hard drive will not be thankful for that

## ram-killer.py

This script will create multiple instances of empty class to overload your RAM

## windows-allerts.py

This script will overload your PC with Windows notifications, my favourite way to cause lag
